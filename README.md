### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarah ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Stockholm based developer looking for my first junior dev position. ðŸ¥³ I've just completed an intensive 24 week frontend/fullstack Boot Camp with [Technigo](https://github.com/Technigo), focussing on Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Express.js and MongoDB.

## Personal highlights of the course
- Agile methodology.
- Seeing a project through from back to front, from initialisation to build.
- Backend design decisions and implications.
- Accessibility.

## What I'm going to learn next
- Typescript (because I like typed languages and it builds on the Javascript I already have)
- Java (because I want to learn a backend focussed language)
- Postgres (to experience using a relational database)

## My favourite projects 
- [Rekredo frontend](https://www.rekredo.com/) and [backend](https://rekredo.herokuapp.com/)
- [Happy thoughts frontend](https://sarah-mottram-happy-thoughts.netlify.app/) and [backend](https://sarah-mottram-happy-thoughts.herokuapp.com/)
- [quiz in Redux and React](https://amazing-tiger-trivia.netlify.app/)
